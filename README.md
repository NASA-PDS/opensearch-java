#opensearch-java for PDS

## Scope

This is a fork of the main branch of https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-java

We created it for the PDS project with the intention of releasing a maven package from the main branch which contain the fix https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-java/issues/1068

We will stop using this fork/release as soon as either:
- opensearch-java provides a stable release depending on HTTP5 client (would be a version 3.X non backward compliant with the 2.X current versions)
- opensearch-java 2.x repending on HTTP4 client fixes the bug https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-java/issues/1103

## Guidelines

# Release the maven package

To Be completed.
